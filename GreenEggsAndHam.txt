The story of green eggs amd ham is well... copywrite soooo here's the story of brightly colored eggs that happen to be the same color as ham. The story starts with a man who refers to himself as dan. Dan he is, is best friends with the guy who hates these colored eggs and ham. Dan has tried everything to get his friend guy to try the eggs and ham with no success. So he disguised the meal as CANDY and with that his friend guy tried the food. He said he hated it but dan swore he has seen his friend eat it everywhere from trains to on a box, heck even with a fox. So after all this he knows that his friend likes brightly colored eggs and ham.
